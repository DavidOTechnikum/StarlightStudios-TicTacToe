## Project Description

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game. <br>
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row.<br>
The row can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The game is played by two players.<br>
Each player has a symbol X or O. The first player to get three of his symbols in a row wins the game.<br>
If the grid is full and no player has three of his symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.<br>

The focus of this project is on the software lifecycle management.<br>
